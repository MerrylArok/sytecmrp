1. First make sure node and npm are installed/ updated
2. Setup new project with vite => npm create vite@latest .(here the . is to say just create the project in current directory, dont make another one here
3. Used Typescript with SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)
4. npm install and then npm run dev
5. Setup Supabase
6. Install @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-ui-react, @supabase/auth-ui-shared
7. git init and then touch .gitignore 
8. touch .env and .env.example
9. Add .env to gitignore
10. Add supbase variables (project url and api anon key) to env. This is for dev only and we need to setup this directly in the server for production.
11. Create env.d.ts in the src folder 	(this will help load the env variables from the env file using Vite, expose Vites functionality and recognize import.meta.env)
12. Create folders under src to start organizing components (src/components/...)
13. Create AuthTest component to check if the env variables are loaded properly and if the supbase connection works
14. Decided to use shadcn
15. Generated a test Auth componenet
16. SQL commands in supabase to initialize roles, user, dept and user-dept table schema,  lock them with with Row Level Security and create policies as to who can update them.
